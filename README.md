Hey there, it's Saymon, and this is my portfolio. It has information about my projects and some of my work experiences. 
I created in a way so that it can easily be taken and turned into your own portfolio with minimal effort. You can customize it to your liking.

Feel free to contribute to it and improve it.

Note: for the sake of simplicity, I only used JSON files for the data displayed like my experience and my projects, but feel free to implement a data base and fetch that data instead of a json file.
in the future I am planning to use a database to store the data instead
