        <h2>Short Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Since I was a child I was always amazed by how the web worked, and my
          journey all started when I hit 13 and started learning software
          development/web design. Extensive track record in creating websites
          that cater to client needs, utilizing HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript.
          Proficient understanding of industry standards for web design, user
          experience, and new technologies have enabled me to always deliver the
          best quality work through my projects.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout the years, I have learned various languages and tech
          stacks. I started with game design with Unity in C#, then I moved to
          Python to practice vision detection. Afterwards, I started learning
          the different languages used for web designing, which include and are
          not limited to, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, ASP.net, and more. As my
          curiosity for learning and playing around with different new
          technologies is never satisfied, I will continue to grow and improve
          my skills to become better day by day.
