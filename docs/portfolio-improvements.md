# Portfolio Structure Audit & Expert Suggestions

## Current Structure Analysis
The current flow is logical and follows standard best practices:

1.  **Hero**: Strong hook and immediate value proposition.
2.  **About**: Sets the context of who you are.
3.  **Projects**: Provides the "proof" of your skills.
4.  **Skills**: Lists your technical toolkit.
5.  **Contact**: Clear call to action.

This **Who -> What -> How -> Action** flow is excellent for conversion.

## Missing "Expert" Elements (Suggestions)

To elevate this to a "Senior/Expert" level portfolio, consider adding the following:

### 1. Social Proof / Testimonials
**Why**: Trust is the currency of the web.
**Suggestion**: Add a **"What People Say"** section. Even if you don't have formal client testimonials, use quotes from:
-   Performance reviews
-   LinkedIn recommendations
-   Peers or mentors

### 2. "How I Work" (Process)
**Why**: Juniors show *code*; Seniors show *problem-solving*.
**Suggestion**: A small section or narrative that explains your approach.
-   "I prioritize accessibility and performance..."
-   "I believe in shipping fast and iterating..."

### 3. Experience / Timeline
**Why**: A structured timeline is easier to scan than a paragraph of text.
**Suggestion**: An **"Experience"** section (distinct from About) that lists roles/companies in reverse chronological order.

### 4. Writing / Thought Leadership
**Why**: Communication is a top-tier skill.
**Suggestion**: A **"Writing"** or **"Blog"** section (or just links to 2-3 Medium/Dev.to articles). This proves you can document and teach, not just code.

## Recommended Changes
I recommend adding a **Process** section between **Projects** and **Skills**. This breaks up the technical density with human/social elements.
