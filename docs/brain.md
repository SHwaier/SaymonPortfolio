## 📜 Rules
1. Never change the rules yourself, only i can change them
2. Develop with a security first approach in mind
3. if you deem it fit, after major changes, or after patches, ask me to commit and push the changes to the repository (if that's ever the case, always ask me)
4. If it is a user facing change that you are making that affects the frontend, develop it with mobile resposivness in mind
